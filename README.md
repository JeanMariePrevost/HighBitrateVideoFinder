# HighBitrateVideoFinder
TLDR: Find all video files in a directory tree and list their size, duration and bitrate.

HighBitrateVideoFinder is a Python tool designed to scan directories for video files, evaluate their bitrate to identify those that would benefit most from re-encoding.

This is just a pet project of mine to sort through my old videos and free up some space on my drives, while getting some experience with Python.
